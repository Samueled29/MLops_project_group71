# MLops_project_group71

The goal of the project is to detect sick/rotten fruits based on their pictures. We aim to achieve this by using a vision transformer model trained on the a dataset obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammad0subhan/fruit-and-vegetable-disease-healthy-vs-rotten/data.

Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer adapted for computer vision tasks. An image is split into smaller fixed-sized patches which are treated as a sequence of tokens, similar to words for NLP tasks. ViT requires less resources to pretrain compared to convolutional architectures and its performance on large datasets can be transferred to smaller downstream tasks.
